# Work cycle and resume point

Last checkpoint: 2026-10-09 14:11

**Read this first when resuming.** It is the single source of truth for where the work stands.

## The cycle (user design, 2026-10-08)

1. **Tokens available:** Claude resumes from this file, runs Opus agents/workflows, and calls `tools/checkpoint.sh "<msg>"` after every completed stage.
2. **Limit reached:** Opus work stops at the five-hour rate limit. Nothing is lost: finished workflow agents are cached (resume with `resumeFromRunId`), and finished stages are committed.
3. **During the wait:** the systemd user timer `hwi-qwen-worker.timer` (every ~2 min) sees the genuine rate-limit event and runs `tools/qwen_worker.py run --auto`. Local Qwen 3.6 27B names unnamed functions into `ghidra/proposals/qwen/naming.jsonl` (append-only, fsynced per function, resumable). It yields to any running game and stops on its own at the reset time.
4. **Reset:** Claude is re-prompted (one-shot CronCreate a few minutes past `resetsAt`, the user's standing rule) and goes back to step 1, folding Qwen's output in through an Opus audit.

### Why there is no "stop at 90%" trigger
Claude Code records no "approaching limit" signal: across a week of transcripts every `quotaLimits` record is `status: rejected` (a hard limit), carrying `rateLimitType: five_hour` and an exact `resetsAt` epoch. So the cycle makes hitting 100% harmless (cached agents, per-stage commits, resumable Qwen queue) instead of guessing at 90%. If a usage-percentage signal ever appears, `claude_limit_state()` in `tools/qwen_worker.py` is the one place to extend.

## Local worker

| | |
|---|---|
| model | `qwen3.6:27b` via Ollama 0.40.1 (system service, flash attention + q8 KV), ctx 8192, ~2 s/function warm, ~28 GB VRAM incl. desktop while loaded, unloads after 5 min idle |
| queue | 8,310 unnamed, decompiled functions of `cataclysm.exe`, most-nameable first |
| output | `ghidra/proposals/qwen/naming.jsonl` → `tools/qwen_worker.py export` → `ghidra/proposals/qwen-naming.json` (binary-map contract) |
| trust | **Unaudited.** Calibration rules: echoing a weak HW1 match caps at medium; a name given to two addresses is marked low with a `[dup]` note. Opus samples it before anything reaches Ghidra |
| control | `tools/qwen_worker.py status` · `run --force --max-items N` (manual) · `systemctl --user stop hwi-qwen-worker.timer` (pause) |
| log | `ghidra/proposals/qwen/worker.log`, `journalctl --user -u hwi-qwen-worker` |

## Orchestrator: ACTIVE since 2026-10-09 12:29 (user chose option B)

A background CLI session `homeworld-orchestrator` (claude --bg, Opus, auto permissions, brief in cycle/ORCHESTRATOR.md) now owns relaunching and chaining the workflows. The IDE session must NOT launch workflows while it is active. Watch: `claude agents`, `claude logs homeworld-orchestrator`; stop: `claude stop homeworld-orchestrator`.

### (history) PAUSED 2026-10-09 12:05

Nothing is running. The in-session round-2 workflow was stopped on purpose (to hand off to a background orchestrator), the auto-mode classifier then refused to start that background session AND refused to relaunch the in-session workflow ("Create Unsafe Agents"). The IDE session also tears down background work after 15-35 idle minutes, which is what kept killing runs. Two ways forward (user's choice):

A. Allow the Workflow tool in Claude Code settings (permission rule for Workflow) and keep using in-session workflows plus a 10-minute relaunch cron.
B. Run the orchestrator yourself, once, from a terminal (lives in the CLI, survives IDE restarts):
   cd ~/Documents/GameDev/Homeworld-Infection && claude --bg --name homeworld-orchestrator --model opus --permission-mode auto --effort high --add-dir "$PWD" "$(cat cycle/ORCHESTRATOR.md)"
   Watch: claude agents   |   claude logs homeworld-orchestrator   |   stop: claude stop homeworld-orchestrator
   If B is chosen, no in-session crons must launch anything (set "orchestrator: active" here).

Round-2 state on disk: A1 complete (r2a export, 13,440 functions); A2 (data names + struct types), producers, audits, reconcile, apply not started. Relaunch = Workflow resumeFromRunId wf_2d9d668a-e53.

## Opus workflows in flight

**Observed 2026-10-09:** the session restarts roughly hourly (00:53, 03:53 restarts logged), which kills any agent that has not written its file yet. The sim-subsystems producer ran 36 min and was lost twice. Rule for every long producer: write its output file incrementally per subsystem (the binary-map script now does this and splits sim into three producers).

Scripts are copied in `cycle/workflows/` so a new session can relaunch them. Resume a run (same session) with `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId})`; in a fresh session, relaunch the script and the finished stages' files on disk are reused.

| workflow | run id | state at last checkpoint | next |
|---|---|---|---|
| dissect-public | `wf_05709792-47f` | COMPLETE 2026-10-08 20:12: 7 docs, all 7 verified (two docs carry two verification rounds). The planner agent stopped on a denied file read, so PLAN.md and README.md were written by the lead instead. | nothing; do not resume |
| binary-map-r1 | `wf_0c18f70b-e23` | COMPLETE 2026-10-09 08:40 (commit 139d7ac): 8,312 symbols applied, 0 failures; real names on 3,867 functions = 46.4% of function bytes; game region 55.3% named (was 2.8%); docs/binary-map.md | round 2 (binary-map-r2.js): create the 2,085 mission functions + ship slot targets, re-admit 925 data names, import struct headers, fill the ranked gaps |
| binary-map-r2 | `wf_b34f7e52-1a1` (orchestrator session; earlier `wf_2d9d668a-e53`) | **COMPLETE 2026-10-09 14:03** (apply rc=0, 962/962 symbols, 0 failures; export `ghidra/exports/cataclysm_gog_r2`). 14,384 functions (A1 created 3,190); real names on 7,055 = 59.7% of function bytes (round 1: 3,867 / 46.4%); game region 65.7% real-named (55.3%); all 2,085 mission functions named, but their Ghidra bodies cover only 50.9% of 0x5d6fe0-0x670a0f; 925 + 51 data labels; 1,735 struct types, 817 globals typed (A2); HW1 matches 3,053 in 180 files. docs/binary-map.md "Round 2"; coverage script `tools/binary_map_coverage.py` | round 3 (docs/binary-map.md R2.6): fix the 984 truncated mission bodies (`missions-r2.body-fix.csv`), name the 548 A1-created `FUN_*` (pointer-table targets; 111 in WON/Magick need a class), create + apply the 105 deferred names, the 2,081 game-region `FUN_*` clusters (skirmish AI, clouds/nebulae, main-view renderer, sensors manager, Leech/RepairDroid ship code), a prototype pass using the A2 types, audit qwen-naming.json |

## Next steps after the workflows land
1. Opus audit of `ghidra/proposals/qwen-naming.json` (30-sample precision) → `qwen-naming.verified.json`, so the next reconcile includes it.
2. Binary-map round 3 (no script yet; write `cycle/workflows/binary-map-r3.js` in the shape of binary-map-r2.js): targets ranked in `docs/binary-map.md` R2.6. Its first stage is a Ghidra body-fix pass for the mission region (no naming needed), then producers for the A1 pointer-table `FUN_*`, the 105 deferred names, the game-region clusters and prototypes. Round-2 A2 work (ImportHeaders.py, prep_ghidra_headers.py, `--post-script` in ghidra_headless.sh, docs/ghidra-round2-prep.md) was merged from the A2 worktree in the round-2 checkpoint.
3. Keep the play-test track separate: `tools/run_game.sh --no-gamescope --virtual-desktop 1920x1080` (gamescope is test-only, docs/CONSTRAINTS.md).
