# Work cycle and resume point

Last checkpoint: 2026-10-09 19:56

**Read this first when resuming.** It is the single source of truth for where the work stands.

## The cycle (user design, 2026-10-08)

1. **Tokens available:** Claude resumes from this file, runs Opus agents/workflows, and calls `tools/checkpoint.sh "<msg>"` after every completed stage.
2. **Limit reached:** Opus work stops at the five-hour rate limit. Nothing is lost: finished workflow agents are cached (resume with `resumeFromRunId`), and finished stages are committed.
3. **During the wait:** the systemd user timer `hwi-qwen-worker.timer` (every ~2 min) sees the genuine rate-limit event and runs `tools/qwen_worker.py run --auto`. Local Qwen 3.6 27B names unnamed functions into `ghidra/proposals/qwen/naming.jsonl` (append-only, fsynced per function, resumable). It yields to any running game and stops on its own at the reset time.
4. **Reset:** Claude is re-prompted (one-shot CronCreate a few minutes past `resetsAt`, the user's standing rule) and goes back to step 1, folding Qwen's output in through an Opus audit.

### Why there is no "stop at 90%" trigger
Claude Code records no "approaching limit" signal: across a week of transcripts every `quotaLimits` record is `status: rejected` (a hard limit), carrying `rateLimitType: five_hour` and an exact `resetsAt` epoch. So the cycle makes hitting 100% harmless (cached agents, per-stage commits, resumable Qwen queue) instead of guessing at 90%. If a usage-percentage signal ever appears, `claude_limit_state()` in `tools/qwen_worker.py` is the one place to extend.

## Local worker

| | |
|---|---|
| model | `qwen3.6:27b` via Ollama 0.40.1 (system service, flash attention + q8 KV), ctx 8192, ~2 s/function warm, ~28 GB VRAM incl. desktop while loaded, unloads after 5 min idle |
| queue | 8,310 unnamed, decompiled functions of `cataclysm.exe`, most-nameable first |
| output | `ghidra/proposals/qwen/naming.jsonl` → `tools/qwen_worker.py export` → `ghidra/proposals/qwen-naming.json` (binary-map contract) |
| trust | **Unaudited.** Calibration rules: echoing a weak HW1 match caps at medium; a name given to two addresses is marked low with a `[dup]` note. Opus samples it before anything reaches Ghidra |
| control | `tools/qwen_worker.py status` · `run --force --max-items N` (manual) · `systemctl --user stop hwi-qwen-worker.timer` (pause) |
| log | `ghidra/proposals/qwen/worker.log`, `journalctl --user -u hwi-qwen-worker` |

## Orchestrator: ACTIVE since 2026-10-09 12:29 (user chose option B)

A background CLI session `homeworld-orchestrator` (claude --bg, Opus, auto permissions, brief in cycle/ORCHESTRATOR.md) now owns relaunching and chaining the workflows. The IDE session must NOT launch workflows while it is active. Watch: `claude agents`, `claude logs homeworld-orchestrator`; stop: `claude stop homeworld-orchestrator`.

### Where the work lives now: branch `m2` (2026-10-10)

Rounds 2-5 are on main (the user fast-forwarded to eae37c9). M2 works on branch `m2` in the worktree `.claude/worktrees/m2`, made from main at eae37c9, because the orchestrator's subagents cannot write to the main checkout and a background session does not merge. The Ghidra exports, `original/` and `reference/` stay in the main checkout; scratch data derived from the game goes to `original/scratch-m2/` (gitignored). Land M2 on main with `git merge --ff-only m2` when you like. The old `r2-apply-coverage` worktree is merged and can be removed: `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/r2-apply`.

### Decisions the user owns
1. M2-R1 runs 11 agents (5 producers, one per M2_BRIEF R1 item, 5 auditors, 1 integrate), close to the brief's "about 10". The brief's "one producer per format" became one formats producer that writes each format doc as it goes, to keep the round near 10 agents. Say if you want the formats split.
2. The bootstrap producer is told to import the ad1bb82 tree plus only the GoK portability fixes it needs; if that grows into hundreds of hand-picked hunks it falls back to importing GoK's whole `src/` and records it here as your decision.
3. Still open from docs/PLAN.md: the M0 play-test sign-off; whether LAN interop with stock 1.01 clients is required.
4. If `/tmp/claude-r3a` still exists (a pre-round-3 copy of the Ghidra project, with the game's program bytes): `rm -rf /tmp/claude-r3a`.

### (history) PAUSED 2026-10-09 12:05

Nothing is running. The in-session round-2 workflow was stopped on purpose (to hand off to a background orchestrator), the auto-mode classifier then refused to start that background session AND refused to relaunch the in-session workflow ("Create Unsafe Agents"). The IDE session also tears down background work after 15-35 idle minutes, which is what kept killing runs. Two ways forward (user's choice):

A. Allow the Workflow tool in Claude Code settings (permission rule for Workflow) and keep using in-session workflows plus a 10-minute relaunch cron.
B. Run the orchestrator yourself, once, from a terminal (lives in the CLI, survives IDE restarts):
   cd ~/Documents/GameDev/Homeworld-Infection && claude --bg --name homeworld-orchestrator --model opus --permission-mode auto --effort high --add-dir "$PWD" "$(cat cycle/ORCHESTRATOR.md)"
   Watch: claude agents   |   claude logs homeworld-orchestrator   |   stop: claude stop homeworld-orchestrator
   If B is chosen, no in-session crons must launch anything (set "orchestrator: active" here).

Round-2 state on disk: A1 complete (r2a export, 13,440 functions); A2 (data names + struct types), producers, audits, reconcile, apply not started. Relaunch = Workflow resumeFromRunId wf_2d9d668a-e53.

## Opus workflows in flight

**Observed 2026-10-09:** the session restarts roughly hourly (00:53, 03:53 restarts logged), which kills any agent that has not written its file yet. The sim-subsystems producer ran 36 min and was lost twice. Rule for every long producer: write its output file incrementally per subsystem (the binary-map script now does this and splits sim into three producers).

Scripts are copied in `cycle/workflows/` so a new session can relaunch them. Resume a run (same session) with `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId})`; in a fresh session, relaunch the script and the finished stages' files on disk are reused.

## Next steps after the workflows land
1. Opus audit of `ghidra/proposals/qwen-naming.json` (30-sample precision) → `qwen-naming.verified.json`, so the next reconcile includes it.
2. Binary-map rounds 1-5 are COMPLETE (rows above). Naming is saturated (docs/binary-map.md R5.7), and the remaining gaps are in R5.6. Qwen's output is still only 12 proposals. With no `FUN_*` left, its queue is empty against `cataclysm_gog_r5`, so step 1 reduces to comparing those 12 with the applied names. Round-2 A2 work (ImportHeaders.py, prep_ghidra_headers.py, `--post-script` in ghidra_headless.sh, docs/ghidra-round2-prep.md) was merged from the A2 worktree in the round-2 checkpoint.
3. Keep the play-test track separate: `tools/run_game.sh --no-gamescope --virtual-desktop 1920x1080` (gamescope is test-only, docs/CONSTRAINTS.md).
